# letter-boxed-solver

The NYT Game Letter Boxed can always be solved in two words. This program finds all possible solutions from the all_words.txt list.

To use, put the letters from the day's puzzle into the puzzle variable so that each set of 3 consecutive letters represents a side of the puzzle. Then run the program.

The all_words.txt file contains a lot of obscure words, so you might have to try several before you find a solution that is accepted by the game.
